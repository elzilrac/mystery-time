### Story
# Her last appearance

You've made your way to Charing Cross station without a hitch. But you don't know where to go.

You've sent your contact a message, and they replied:

*"That's part of the problem, unforunately. The caller wasn't clear about the specific location. They just told us that we'll see signs at the station. What do you think that means?"*
